        <p>
          Hi, I'm David! Iâ€™m passionate about exploring how machines can learn
          and understand the world around us. I'm currently a Member of
          Technical Staff at OpenAI working on applied AI.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously, I worked on my own startup building gen AI animation
          tools, and also at Google and Redfin. I graduated from MIT with an
          M.Eng. in CS in 2024 and a B.S. in CS and Physics in 2023.
